# FreeCC_MatchingCards
JavaScript Focused card game

Premise of the game is very simple:
Match the programming language logos in pairs. 
If you get the match wrong, the game will flip the cards back over. On each refresh the cards will be randomly shuffled. You can only select 2 cards at a time, and you cannot reselect the same card!

I followed along with a Youtube tutorial from Free Code Camp to create this project.

- The HTML elements are essentially just the cards and their tags.
- The CSS elements control the positioning and animation for the most part.
- And the actual control and feedback is created using  the JavaScript, focusing on if {} else {} statements.
